1.1. RDBMS- Relational Database Management System



1.2. Attempting to print without strings results in a ‘SyntaxError’, as Python expects strings to be denoted through single (‘) or double (“) quotation marks. If there are no quotation marks, Python fails to read the message as a string and will interpret it as a variable and will raise a ‘SyntaxError’ because it doesn’t recognise the variable.


1.3 Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free control system used to handle small to large projects efficiently. It allows multiple developers to work together.


1.4 A composite key



1.5 Give an example of an API. Application Programming Interface. An example of an API is the Harry Potter API which provides information about the movie ranging from characters, to which house they belong to and what spells were performed. https://hp-api.onrender.com/



1.6  Testing and Debugging:
Devs are responsible for testing their code and identifying any errors or bugs that may have occurred during the development process. Debugging involves troubleshooting and resolving issues in the code ensuring that the software functions as intended. 

Code writing and maintenance: 
Devs are also responsible for writing and maintaining code for software applications or systems. This involves translating design specifications into functional and efficient code. 




1.7 One of the considerations when designing a shopping website is the user experience and ensuring that the website is clear and concise for the user’s to navigate and find products quickly. It is also important to make sure that the security of the website is being considered as it is essential to protect user data during transactions so their information cannot be accessed by third parties. This ties in with potential problems as vulnerabilities in the website can cause a breach of data which may compromise sensitive user data. It can also lead to fraud which causes financial losses and can damage the credibility of the website. Another problem can be technical issues, if there’s a problem with a server this can lead to website downtime which can affect user experience and sales. 



1.8 This function would throw an error when called if the denominator value passed is zero. This is because numbers cannot mathematically be divided by 0 as it produces an error message. In this case when the code is run with 0 as the denominator, it results in a ZeroDivisionError.

To avoid this error, using exception handling I would create a check in my function to make sure that the denominator is not 0 before executing the division.

Here I added a conditional check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where the ‘denominator’ is zero as I wanted to ensure the function doesn’t attempt to divide by 0. This checks if the denominator is zero before attempting the division operation. If the denominator is zero, it immediately returns an error message without performing the calculation. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the percentage.

1.9  I argue that agile project management is favourable to the waterfall method as it’s flexible and allows room for change, whereas the waterfall method is rigid and doesn’t allow for changes as effectively as the agile method. Agile is a mindset. The Agile Manifesto consists of four key values:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
Working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
Responding to change over following a plan.

But agile project management contains many methods such as SCRUM, Kanban, SAFe and  Extreme Programming. These frameworks provide room for adaptability and continuous feedback to improve operations. The agile method breaks projects down into smaller increments so the workload is more manageable, helps to uncover issues early as it encourages integration points to learn fast and also permits frequent reviews and adjustments. In stark contrast, the waterfall method requires each stage to be completed before moving on to the next. It makes it difficult for developers to accommodate changes once one phase is completed and also the value of the product decreases in waterfall since it is a big bang release.

On the other hand, the agile method works in smaller increments, which lets products enter the market quicker and this is advantageous with competitive industries. There is also the aspect of risk mitigation, whereby issues can be addressed early as there are constant reviews which reduces the risk of failure later on in the project. Overall, I would say that the agile method is definitely the more preferred method due to its adaptability especially with today’s dynamic and rapidly evolving industries. The waterfall method is outdated and is likely to cause issues therefore it is not the best method to use.

SDLC stands for the Software Development Life Cycle which is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The stages of the SDLC are planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance. 

The first planning stage is extremely important as this is the stage where the team decide on the requirements of the new software. The second step is gathering as much information from the clients about their requirements for the product. In this stage, the development team will analyse the requirements to scope whether it is feasible to incorporate these requirements in the new software, whilst also keeping the code and design in mind. The main objective in this stage is to ensure that both customer and developers know every little detail about the requirements eg. hardware, programming and security. 

In the next step, the program developer investigates whether the project is attainable financially, practically and technologically. The developer then selects the programming languages to suit the software and this is then passed on to the stakeholders to give their suggestions and feedback. This is an essential step as everything needs to be approved to avoid mistakes which can lead to a cost overrun. 

The implementation stage is considered one of the longest stages as this is where the tasks are divided into modules or units and assigned to various developers. The developers will write the code based on the chosen language and it needs to be shown to the business analysts in case any modifications are required.

The testing phase is where the testing team tests the code written to make sure the code is working effectively and there are no bugs. If bugs are found, it is handed back to the development team to fix the issues. This process is repeated until there are no more bugs and the team has secured a stable software. 

The sixth phase is the deployment phase which is where the product is released to the public for customers to use, the complexity of this phase depends on the size of the product. The users are provided with the training or documentation needed to operate the software. The last stage is maintenance, users will experience issues with the software from time to time which need to be solved, and the software is updated from time to time.
